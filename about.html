            Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) are the state standards for the US state of Texas public schools from kindergarten to year 12.[1] They detail the curriculum requirements for every course. State-mandated standardized tests measure acquisition of specific knowledge and skills outlined in this curriculum. It is also used in international schools outside of Texas. The TEKS are taught to students and within the end of the year, they take a standardized test based on the TEKS called the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness.Standards are created and agreed upon by the State Board of Education (SBOE) which is the legislative organization that forms the committee to review the TEKS. The committee consists of members nominate educators, parents, business and industry representatives, and employers.An academy (Attic Greek: Ἀκαδήμεια; Koine Greek Ἀκαδημία) is an institution of secondary or tertiary higher learning (and generally also research or honorary membership). The name traces back to Plato's school of philosophy, founded approximately 386 BC at Akademia, a sanctuary of Athena, the goddess of wisdom and skill, north of Athens, Greece.The Royal Spanish Academy defines academy as scientific, literary or artistic society established with public authority and as a teaching establishment, public or private, of a professional, artistic, technical or simply practical nature.
